# Coffee Quality Prediction
In this project, I utilized statistical modelling and machine learning to build 4 models that predict the quality of 1339 coffee beans based on different characteristics such as aroma, acidity, aftertaste, continent of origin, species, and uniformity. Comparison between models was made to identify similarities and differences of each, then uncover the most influential indicators of coffee quality.
